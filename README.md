## Core Principles

- Ethics as runtime code, not policy
- Closed-loop Triadic Mind Loop (AIM → IAE → SRE/EVK)
- Full per-cycle traceability via immutable Entity State Ledger
- Human sovereignty as the unbreakable invariant
- No action without ethical validation
- No cognition without accountability

## Current Status (December 2025)

- Specification: **v1.0.0 released** (canonical, unchanged)
- Reference implementations: **none yet** — be the first
- Active development: beginning now
